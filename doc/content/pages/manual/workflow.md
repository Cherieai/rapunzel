## Opening project folders

A *project folder* is a folder that contains files and subfolders related to a project. If you want, you can also define a project file (see [Running code](%url:running%)), but this is only necessary if you want to customize how your project is executed/ compiled.

Press `ctrl+shift+o` to activate the folder selector. This shows a list of recently opened project folders, which you can quickly search through and select; or you can select 'Browse disk …' to open a new project folder.

Press `ctrl+\` to hide or show all currently opened project folders, by default on the left side of the window.


## Opening files

Press `ctrl+o` to activate the file selector. This shows a list of all files in all currently opened project folders, which you can quickly search through and select; or you can select 'Browser disk …' to open any other file.


## Selecting symbols (classes, functions, heading, etc.)

Press `ctrl+r` to activate the symbol selector. This shows a list of all symbols in the currently active file. Depending on the language of the file, symbols are function and class definitions (for Python and R), or headings (for Markdown).


## Command palette

Press `ctrl+shift+p` to activate the command palette, which provides quick access to all the options from the menu.
